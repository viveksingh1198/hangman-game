Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters one at a time. The word to guess is represented 
by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessed letter is present in the word, the dashes corresponding to that letter are replaced with the letter. If the guessed
letter is not in the word, the player loses a chance. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of chances.
